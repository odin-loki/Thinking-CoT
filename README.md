# Thinking-CoT
A distributed AI system that combines Chain of Thought and Cell AI to process data patterns, using bounded recursive thinking and noise-based creativity. It learns from successes/failures, stores patterns efficiently, and generates insights while maintaining mathematical bounds to prevent infinite loops.
